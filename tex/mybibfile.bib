	abstract = {ABSTRACT For engineers, it is interesting to gain insight in the effect of control strategies on microbial communities, on their turn influencing the process behavior and its stability. This contribution assesses the influence of process dynamics on the microbial community in a biofilm reactor for nitrogen removal, which was controlled according to several strategies aiming at nitrite accumulation. The process dataset, combining conventional chemical and physical data with molecular information, was analyzed through a correlation analysis and in a simulation study. During nitrate formation, an increased nitrogen loading rate (NLR) resulted in a drop of the bulk liquid oxygen concentration without resulting in nitrite accumulation. A biofilm model was able to reproduce the bulk liquid nitrogen concentrations in two periods before and after this increased NLR. As the microbial parameters calibrated for the ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite‐oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in both periods were different, it was concluded that the increased NLR governed an AOB and NOB population shift. Based on the molecular data, it was assumed that each period was typified by one dominant AOB and probably several subdominant NOB populations. The control strategies for nitrite accumulation influenced the bulk liquid composition by controlling the competition between AOB and NOB. Biotechnol.

	abstract = {In a previous study, the two nitrifying functions (ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB)) of a nitrification reactor—operated continuously over 525 days with varying inputs—were assigned using a mathematical modeling approach together with the monitoring of bacterial phylotypes. Based on these theoretical identifications, we develop here a chemostat model that does not explicitly include only the resources' dynamics (different forms of soluble nitrogen) but also explicitly takes into account microbial inter- and intra-species interactions for the four dominant phylotypes detected in the chemostat. A comparison of the models obtained with and without interactions has shown that such interactions permit the coexistence of two competing ammonium-oxidizing bacteria and two competing nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in competition for ammonium and nitrite, respectively. These interactions are analyzed and discussed.},

Fitness is defined following ecological convention as the proportion of genes left in the population gene pool (Pianka, 1983, p. 10). The terms r and K refer, respectively, to the maximum specific rate of increase (maximum specific growth rate minus minimum specific death rate) of an organism and to the density of individuals that a given environment can support at the population equilibrium. Since both r and K can vary within a species and are subject to modification, the division of natural selection into r- and K-selection is of considerable basic interest in evolutionary ecology.",

Despite this conspicuous deviation from single-copy genes, no phenotype has been consistently associated with rRNA gene copy number. We found that the number of rRNA genes correlates with the rate at which phylogenetically diverse bacteria respond to resource availability. Soil bacteria that formed colonies rapidly upon exposure to a nutritionally complex medium contained an average of 5.5 copies of the small subunit rRNA gene, whereas bacteria that responded slowly contained an average of 1.4 copies. In soil microcosms pulsed with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), indigenous populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria with multiple rRNA genes (	= 5.4) became dominant, whereas populations with fewer rRNA genes (	= 2.7) were favored in unamended controls. These findings demonstrate phenotypic effects associated with rRNA gene copy number that are indicative of ecological strategies influencing the structure of natural microbial communities.},

Chemolitho-autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are responsible for the rate-limiting step of nitrification in a wide variety of environments, making them important in the global cycling of nitrogen. These organisms are unique in their ability to use the conversion of ammonia to nitrite as their sole energy source. Because of the importance of this functional group of bacteria, understanding of their ecology and physiology has become a subject of intense research over recent years. The monophyletic nature of these bacteria in terrestrial environments has facilitated molecular biological approaches in studying their ecology, and progress in this field has been rapid. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria of the β-subclass Proteobacteria have become somewhat of a model system within molecular microbial ecology, and this chapter reviews recent progress in our knowledge of their distribution, diversity, and ecology. }

	abstract = {A new method is introduced to design optimal tracking controllers for a general class of nonlinear systems. A recently developed recursive approximation theory is applied to solve the nonlinear optimal tracking control problem explicitly by classical means. This reduces the nonlinear problem to a sequence of linear-quadratic and time-varying approximating problems which, under very mild conditions, globally converge in the limit to the nonlinear systems considered. The converged control input from the approximating sequence is then applied to the nonlinear system. The method is used to design an autopilot for the ESSO 190, 000-dwt oil tanker. This multi-input-multi-output nonlinear super-tanker model is well established in the literature and represents a challenging problem for control design, where the design requirement is to follow a commanded maneuver at a desired speed. The performance index is selected so as to minimize: (a) the tracking error for a desired course heading, and (b) the rudder deflection angle to ensure that actuators operate within their operating limits. This will present a trade-off between accurate tracking and reduced actuator usage (fuel consumption) as they are both mutually dependent on each other. Simulations of the nonlinear super-tanker control model are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the nonlinear tracking controller. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We discuss here the algebraic properties of the GLV family, such as the invariance under quasimonomial transformations and the underlying structure of classes of equivalence. Each class possesses a unique representative under the classical quadratic Lotka-Volterra form. We show how other standard modeling forms of biological interest, such as S-systems or mass-action systems, are naturally embedded into the GLV form, which thus provides a formal framework for their comparison and for the establishment of transformation rules. We also focus on the issue of recasting of general nonlinear systems into the GLV format. We present a procedure for doing so and point at possible sources of ambiguity that could make the resulting Lotka-Volterra system dependent on the path followed. We then provide some general theorems that define the operational and algorithmic framework in which this is not the case.},

It used to be assumed that bacteria and other microorganisms lived relatively independent unicellular lives, without the cooperative behaviors that have provoked so much interest in mammals, birds, and insects. However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation. Our aim here is to review these social behaviors, emphasizing the unique opportunities they offer for testing existing evolutionary theory as well as highlighting the novel theoretical problems that they pose.},

	abstract = {Since the mid-90 s, State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) strategies have emerged as general design methods that provide a systematic and effective means of designing nonlinear controllers, observers, and filters. These methods overcome many of the difficulties and shortcomings of existing methodologies, and deliver computationally simple algorithms that have been highly effective in a variety of practical and meaningful applications. In a special session at the 17th IFAC Symposium on Automatic Control in Aerospace 2007, theoreticians and practitioners in this area of research were brought together to discuss and present SDRE-based design methodologies as well as review the supporting theory. It became evident that the number of successful simulation, experimental and practical real-world applications of SDRE control have outpaced the available theoretical results. This paper reviews the theory developed to date on SDRE nonlinear regulation for solving nonlinear optimal control problems, and discusses issues that are still open for investigation. Existence of solutions as well as stability and optimality properties associated with SDRE controllers are the main contribution in the paper. The capabilities, design flexibility and art of systematically carrying out an effective SDRE design are also emphasized, demonstrating how several situations that prevent the direct application of the SDRE technique, such as the existence of state and control constraints, can be readily handled using this method.

In this paper we propose a generic method coupling fingerprinting and mathematical tools to achieve the functional assigning of bacteria detected in microbial consortia. This approach was tested on a nitrification bioprocess where two functions carried out by two different communities could be clearly distinguished. The mathematical theory of observers of dynamical systems has been used to design a dynamic estimator of the active biomass concentration of each functional community from the available measurements on nitrifying performance. Then, the combination of phylotypes obtained by fingerprinting that best approximated the estimated trajectories of each functional biomass was selected through a random optimization method. By this way, a nitritation or nitratation function was assigned to each phylotype detected in the ecosystem by means of functional molecular fingerprints. The results obtained by this approach were successfully compared with the information obtained from 16S rDNA identification. This original approach can be used on any biosystem involving n successive cascading bioreactions performed by n communities.},

This technique is based on the separation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of genes coding for 16S rRNA, all the same length, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, and thereby generated a DGGE profile of the populations. We showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only 1{\%} of the total population. With an oligonucleotide probe specific for the V3 region of 16S rRNA of sulfate-reducing bacteria, particular DNA fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by hybridization analysis. Analysis of the genomic DNA from a bacterial biofilm grown under aerobic conditions suggests that sulfate-reducing bacteria, despite their anaerobicity, were present in this environment. The results we obtained demonstrate that this technique will contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of uncharacterized microbial populations.},

To date, most analyses have focused on either (a) verifying phylogenies of individual genes thought to have been transferred, or (b) estimating the fraction of individual genomes likely to have been introduced by transfer. Neither approach does justice to the ability of LGT to effect massive and complex transformations in basic biology. In some cases, such transformation will be manifested as the patchy distribution of a seemingly fundamental property (such as aerobiosis or nitrogen fixation) among the members of a group classically defined by the sharing of other properties (metabolic, morphological, or molecular, such as small subunit ribosomal RNA sequence). In other cases, the lineage of recipients so transformed may be seen to comprise a new group of high taxonomic rank ("class" or even "phylum"). Here we review evidence for an important role of LGT in the evolution of photosynthesis, aerobic respiration, nitrogen fixation, sulfate reduction, methylotrophy, isoprenoid biosynthesis, quorum sensing, flotation (gas vesicles), thermophily, and halophily. Sometimes transfer of complex gene clusters may have been involved, whereas other times separate exchanges of many genes must be invoked.},

MCs underpin the biogeochemical cycles of the earth's soil, oceans and the atmosphere, and perform ecosystem functions that impact plants, animals and humans. Yet our ability to predict and manage the function of these highly complex, dynamically changing communities is limited. Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we argue that addressing this challenge requires close coordination of experimental data collection and method development with mathematical model building. We discuss specific examples where model-experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure. We also highlight key research questions that still demand better integration of experiments and models. We argue that such integration is needed to achieve significant progress in our understanding of MC dynamics and function, and we make specific practical suggestions as to how this could be achieved.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 29 March 2016; doi:10.1038/ismej.2016.45.},

	abstract = {Background: Dynamic modelling provides a systematic framework to understand function in biological systems. Parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonconvexity and ill-conditioning. Associated issues like overfitting and local solutions are usually not properly addressed in the systems biology literature despite their importance. Here we present a method for robust and efficient parameter estimation which uses two main strategies to surmount the aforementioned difficulties: (i) efficient global optimization to deal with nonconvexity, and (ii) proper regularization methods to handle ill-conditioning. In the case of regularization, we present a detailed critical comparison of methods and guidelines for properly tuning them. Further, we show how regularized estimations ensure the best trade-offs between bias and variance, reducing overfitting, and allowing the incorporation of prior knowledge in a systematic way. Results: We illustrate the performance of the presented method with seven case studies of different nature and increasing complexity, considering several scenarios of data availability, measurement noise and prior knowledge. We show how our method ensures improved estimations with faster and more stable convergence. We also show how the calibrated models are more generalizable. Finally, we give a set of simple guidelines to apply this strategy to a wide variety of calibration problems. Conclusions: Here we provide a parameter estimation strategy which combines efficient global optimization with a regularization scheme. This method is able to calibrate dynamic models in an efficient and robust way, effectively fighting overfitting and allowing the incorporation of prior information.},
